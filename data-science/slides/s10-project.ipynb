    "From those searching, it looks like crime statistics require quite a period for the data to come out. For concrete data, we can only get prelimilary data up to 2019. The data for 2020 is unstructured and hard to find.\n",
    "\n",
    "This make sense because such researches require accurate historical data. On the other hand, what we intend to do, is using some temperary information to predict crime rates in near future. This may or may not be that accurate, but could provide a pespective. A previous approach from Twitter data can be found [here](https://sci-hub.st/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323532548_Mining_Twitter_data_for_crime_trend_prediction)\n",
