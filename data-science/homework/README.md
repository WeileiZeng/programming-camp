everyone's homework will be saved in the corresponding folder.

Practice is very important.

How much you put in the class is how much you will get!


### Format

Create a .ipynb file for each week. The file should contain what you have practiced for the week. If there is no particular tasks assigned, this would just be a record of your coding. You will get feedbacks of those files.

File format: w[N]-[topic].ipynb

e.g. w2-datatypes.ipynb
