"1 The actual number of incidents is 7,120. However, the column figures will not add to the total because incidents may include more than one offense type, and these are counted in each appropriate offense type category.",,,,,
"2 The term victim may refer to an individual, business/financial institution, government entity, religious organization, or society/public as a whole.",,,,,
"3 The term known offender does not imply the suspect's identity is known; rather, the term indicates some aspect of the suspect was identified, thus distinguishing the suspect from an unknown offender. The actual number of known offenders is 6,266. However, the column figures will not add to the total because some offenders are responsible for more than one offense type, and are, therefore, counted more than once in this table.",,,,,
4 Only the revised Uniform Crime Reporting definition of rape was used for the figures reported in this row. See the data declaration for further explanation. ,,,,,
"5 The figures shown include additional offenses collected in the National Incident-Based Reporting 
System. See Methodology.",,,,,
