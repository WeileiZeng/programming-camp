# Homework for the class
everyone's homework will be saved in the corresponding folder.

Practice is very important.

How much you put in the class is how much you will get!


### Format

Create a .ipynb file for each week. The file should contain what you have practiced for the class. If there is no particular tasks assigned, this would just be a record of your coding. Please email the file to weilei.zeng@foxmail.com You will get feedbacks of those files.
