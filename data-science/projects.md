## How to choose a topic?

There are just a lot of interesting questions to work on. But how should you choose? There are several hints.

- The topic should be general, and related to your own life
  - You may not be familiar with the coding part, which we are going
    to learn in this class. But the topic you choose should be general
    enough to understand, and should be related to your own life. It
    should happen in your own life for several times, and you expect
    this approach to offer you a different perspective to the
    question.
- Think about source of data
  - what kind of data can give related information, where to get it?
  - what kind of data we can process? texts, articles, numbers, tables, ...
- Big picture?
  - What problem will it solve? Practicaly is it helpful for others?

When working on data science projects, there are always surprises and difficulties. We would only find out when actually doing the work. Eventually, for a given topic,  we would come up with a propoal of converting data sources into meaningful information.

Overall, don't worry if those are unclear during brain storming. It is part of the process to make the proposal clear.
