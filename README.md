# Programming projects for high school students

This is a list of programming projects on various topics, designed for a high school student to finish in an 8-session class.

Students can work in a group of 2 or 3 as well. In the beginning, one would identify a topic to work on, and then discuss the detail of implementation in program. The topics include but are not limited to the following.

## projects

  - [Build a website in an application, no programming is needed](https://mobirise.com/)


- Data processing/ natrual language processing
  - Use python to download millions of data, and extract useful information. It all starts from a great and simple question: what do you want to know from the Internet?
  - __twitter__: From what people talk about on twitter, one can analyze a lot of interesting questions, for example
